# project-euler-1
 This repository contains some challenges I took up from the Project Euler problem list
 Doing this exercise is neither to show off interest in pure mathematics (which I don't have),
 nor that of Python. But it is to keep myself in an analytical mindset through mini projects
 and mini conquests. This, I hope will especially be useful to bring my focus back instead of
 flying to the moon, or to get me back to programming (even if it is just simple).
